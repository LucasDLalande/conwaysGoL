Description: `conwayGoL` is a small package designed to toy around with Conway's Game of Life.
    It allows to observe the evolution of artificial life across generations on a torroidal grid.
    The characteristics of the initial generation can be decided (a random grid with a chose proportion of living and dead cells, one or more specific patterns).
    Users have the possibility to use patterns store in the patterns library available with the package and to permanently add their own patterns to it.
    They can also convert `.rle` files into binary matrices compatible with the package functions.
